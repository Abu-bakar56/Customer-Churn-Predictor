![bb](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fb06b0e-2915-4fc0-bd2b-f6bbba19acdf)


## Overview

The Customer Churn Predictor is a Flask-based web application designed to predict whether a customer in a telecom company is likely to churn. By analyzing various customer data features, the model provides an accurate prediction of churn likelihood, helping the company take proactive measures to retain customers.

## Features

- **Data Input:** Enter customer details through an intuitive web form.
- **Churn Prediction:** The machine learning model predicts if a customer will churn.
- **Data Analysis:** Visual analysis of the customer data used in model training.
- **Responsive UI:** Mobile-friendly interface for easy access.

## Video Demonstration

   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
2. Input customer data in the form provided.
3. Submit to receive the churn prediction.

## Model and Methodology

The model was trained on a telecom customer dataset using various machine learning algorithms. After evaluating different models, the one with the highest accuracy was selected for deployment. Feature scaling, encoding, and hyperparameter tuning were key steps in the model development process.
