## Overview

The Customer Churn Predictor is a Flask-based web application designed to predict whether a customer in a telecom company is likely to churn. By analyzing various customer data features, the model provides an accurate prediction of churn likelihood, helping the company take proactive measures to retain customers.

## Features

- **Data Input:** Enter customer details through an intuitive web form.
- **Churn Prediction:** The machine learning model predicts if a customer will churn.
- **Data Analysis:** Visual analysis of the customer data used in model training.
- **Responsive UI:** Mobile-friendly interface for easy access.
